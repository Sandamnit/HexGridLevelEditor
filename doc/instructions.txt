Order of Operations
-------------------
1. Attack operations
	a. LSR (6)
	b. BMB (7)
2. Movement operations
	a. FWD (1)
	b. BWD (2)
	c. CW (3)
	d. CCW (4)
	e. 180 (5)
3. Power operations
	a. OFF (8)
	b. SHLD (11)
	c. NOP (0)
	
IF (9) conditionals and SUB (10) are resolved at the beginning of the phase and placed according to the op order above.
	For example, given the following instruction set:
		...
		IF <FACING AI>
			LSR
		NOP
		...
	If the AI were adjacent to an adversary at the beginning of the phase, it would be flagged as a BMB instruction and occur first;
	On the other hand, if the AI is not adjacent to an adversary, it would be flagged as a NOP instruction and occur last.

An array is then populated based upon all AI in the game world and ordered according to the operations they are attempting to execute.
When two AI attempt to execute the same instruction during the same phase, priority goes to the player AI, and then the adversarial AI
in the order which they were instantiated in the game world.


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAYER/AI USE
--------------------------------------
 0 == NOP
	- This instruction means "no operation".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI does nothing, and gains back 5% of its power.
	
 1 == FWD <n>
	- This instruction means "forward".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI moves n units forward in the direction it is oriented.

 2 == BWD <n>
	- This instruction means "backward".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI moves n units backward away from the direction it is oriented.
	
 3 == CW <n>
	- This instruction means "clockwise".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI rotates clockwise (to the right) by n units.
	
 4 == CCW <n>
	- This instruction means "counterclockwise".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI rotates counterclock (to the left) by n units.
	
 5 == 180
	- This instruction means "rotate 180 degrees".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI rotates 180 degrees, effectively turning around.
	
 6 == LSR
	- This instruction means "fire laser".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI fires a laser in the direction it is oriented, damaging any AI in its path.
	
 7 == BMB <t>
	- This instruction means "drop bomb".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI drops a bomb in its current location which will detonate in t units of time.

 8 == OFF
	- This instruction means "power off".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI immediately powers off (rendering it immobile) for 3 units of time.
	- When an AI is powered off, it immediately recovers to full power; however, it receives double damage while in this mode.
	
 9 == IF <cond>
	- This instruction means "if condition is met, execute the following line".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI checks the condition specified and if that condition is met, the following instruction is executed;
	    otherwise, this instruction is ignored and the AI executes the next instruction.
	- For a list of conditions which can be met, see the 'conditions.txt' file.
		
10 == SUB <n>
	- This instruction means "execute specified subroutine".
	- When this instrucction is executed, the first instruction of the specified subroutine is executed.
	
11 == SHLD <t>
	- This instruction means "enable shield".
	- When this instruction is executed, the AI's shield (if it has one) is enabled for t units of time, starting immediately.
	- For each unit of time the shield is activated, the AI loses 10% of its power and take no damage in the direction it is oriented,
	    as well as two adjacent orientations. For example, with the AI facing up, the shield blocks damage received from up-left, up, and up-right directions.

12 == Reserved
13 == Reserved
14 == Reserved
15 == Reserved
	
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADVERSARIAL AI ONLY
------------------------------------
These instructions are not accessible to the player, but are intended to provide useful tools for the adverserial AI.

16 = ???
